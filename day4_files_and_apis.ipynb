    "## Topic 1 – Objects, classes, instances and types (recap)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge: what these words mean\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **object** is any value that lives in memory while your program runs. Numbers, strings, lists, and things you create with `class` are all objects.\n",
    "- A **class** is a *blueprint* for creating objects of a certain kind. It describes what data they have and what they can do.\n",
    "- An **instance** (often called an \"object\" in everyday speech) is one concrete thing created from a class. If `Person` is a class, then `Person(\"Anna\")` creates one instance.\n",
    "- A **type** is the kind of an object. For built in things like `5` the type is `int`. For objects you define, the type is your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relations to earlier material:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you wrote `x = 5` or `text = \"hi\"`, you already worked with objects. You just did not call them that.\n",
    "- `type(x)` is a function you already saw; it returns the class of the object stored in `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to think about these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you design a small model of the real world, like `Person`, `Order`, or `Invoice`, you are deciding which classes you need.\n",
    "- When you see an error like `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'`, it means you tried to use a string method on an object whose type is `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common confusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Is an object the same as an instance?\" – In practice, yes; most people use the words as synonyms. More precisely: an instance is an object that was created from a class.\n",
    "- \"Is a class the same as a type?\" – Almost. In modern Python, user defined types are implemented as classes, and `type(obj)` usually returns the class of `obj`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world style example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **class** `Car` describes what every car knows (brand, year) and can do (start, stop).\n",
    "- Your actual **car** in the parking lot is one **instance** of that class.\n",
    "- The **type** of that instance in Python is `<class 'Car'>`.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Dictionary unpacking with `**` in a function call**\n",
    "   - If you have a dictionary, `**` in front of it will pass its key value pairs as separate keyword arguments.\n",
    "   - Example: if `data = {\"name\": \"Anna\", \"age\": 30}`, then `show_person(**data)` is the same as `show_person(name=\"Anna\", age=30)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collecting extra keyword arguments with `**kwargs` in a function definition**\n",
    "   - Inside a function definition, `**kwargs` means: \"collect any extra keyword arguments into a dictionary called `kwargs`\".\n",
    "   - The name `kwargs` is a convention; the important part is the `**`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common confusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"What type is `kwargs`?\" – It is a **dictionary**.\n",
    "- \"Can I mix normal parameters, `*args`, and `**kwargs`?\" – Yes. The usual order is: normal parameters, then `*args`, then `**kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world style example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A configuration function might accept many optional settings:\n",
    "  - `setup_db(host=\"localhost\", port=5432, debug=True, timeout=30)`\n",
    "  - Using `**kwargs`, the function can forward these options to another lower level function.\n"
