    "In almost every real-world Python project you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read input** from files (CSV exports, logs, config files, reports)\n",
    "- **Write output** to files (results, logs, generated documents)\n",
    "- Talk to other systems over the network using **HTTP APIs** (web services, LLMs, payment providers, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of files and APIs as two major ways your program connects to the outside world:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files: slower but often large, persistent data living on disk\n",
    "- HTTP APIs: remote services that can answer questions, store data, or perform actions for you\n",

    "Today we learn the basic tools for both.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Under the hood, Python file objects wrap OS level file descriptors. Most operations eventually become system calls like `open`, `read`, `write` in the operating system.\n",
    "- HTTP is a **text-based protocol**. Even when you send JSON, underneath it is just text sent over TCP.\n"

    "Important file modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'` - read (file must exist)\n",
    "- `'w'` - write (overwrite or create)\n",
    "- `'a'` - append (add to end, create if missing)\n",
    "- `'rb'`, `'wb'` - binary read/write (images, non-text data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common file methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `f.read()` - read the whole file as a single string\n",
    "- `f.readline()` - read one line at a time\n",
    "- `f.readlines()` - read all lines into a list of strings\n",
    "- `f.write(text)` - write a string to the file (returns number of bytes/characters)\n",
    "- `f.writelines(list_of_strings)` - write a list of strings\n",
    "- `f.close()` - release the file resource\n",
